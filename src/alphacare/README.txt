Hello, I added the good defaults design pattern to the loginUI and CreateAccountUIs.

I added Mediator called DoctorPatient, and the two children of User, MedicalUser and Patient User.

You can test the functionality of DoctorPatient by running the Test Harness java file. 

If it is successfully tested, you can see the following results:

-DoctorPatient Mediator Successfully removed a medical user
-DoctorPatient Mediator Successfully executed addPatientDoctors
-DoctorPatient Mediator Successfully removed a medical user
-DoctorPatient Mediator Successfully executed all functions
