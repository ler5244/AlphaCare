The object-oriented design pattern for this is the abstract factory creational pattern. For this, I made the user be a super class to the PatientUser and DoctorUser classes. As for the user interface design pattern, I selected the password strength meter. In this case, I added a notification under the password input text field to tell the user the current strength of their password based on the length. As they type in a password, it will update to tell the user if their password strength is weak, moderate, or strong, and it appears in text under the input field. This code can be found inside of the CreateAccountUIController class.
